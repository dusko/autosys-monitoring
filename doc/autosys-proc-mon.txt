FILES
  ../bin/autosys-proc-mon.pl
    Script for AutoSys service monitoring.

  ../conf/exclude-list.cfg
    Configuration file what contains list of all service names what will be
    excluded from monitoring. One service name per line.

    Example:

  ../data/arming-status.dat
    This datafile holds the value of the "arming" counter. If we detect that
    monitored service is not running we send an alert email. To don't
    generate alert email each polling cycle next email will be send if
    counter will be set to zero value.

    *       Counter is set to 0 if all services are up and running.

    *       If monitored service goes down, alert email is send and counter
            is set to default value (like 12).

    *       If service is still down we decrement counter by 1 each polling
            cycle until it reach zero and new alert email can be send.

    *       We can say that counter represent quiet period (like 60 min)
            when no new mail is send even if monitored service is down.

    DON'T edit this file manually as it is fully managed by the script !!!

  ../log/autosys-proc-mon.log
    Script log all activities to this file.
